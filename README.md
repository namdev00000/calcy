# My Calcy - A Versatile Calculator

My Calcy is a modern, interactive web-based calculator that goes beyond basic arithmetic, offering a suite of advanced mathematical functions, theme customization, and an intuitive user experience. This project was brought to life with the creative assistance of Google Antigravity Vibe Coding (Gemini CLI).

## Features

My Calcy is packed with functionalities to cover a wide range of calculations:

### Basic Operations
*   **Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), Division (÷):** Perform standard arithmetic calculations.
*   **Clear (AC):** Resets the calculator display and state.
*   **Delete (DEL):** Removes the last entered digit or operation.
*   **Decimal Support:** Handle non-integer numbers.

### Advanced Mathematical Functions
Accessible via the feature bar above the main keypad:
*   **Even or Odd Check (`#`):** Determine if a number is even or odd.
*   **Square (`x²`):** Calculate the square of a number.
*   **Cube (`x³`):** Calculate the cube of a number.
*   **Percentage Calculator (`%`):** Calculate percentages in various modes (e.g., "What % is X of Y?", "What is X% of Y?").
*   **Square Root (`√`):** Find the square root of a number.
*   **Cube Root (`∛`):** Find the cube root of a number.
*   **Multiplication Table (`📋`):** Generate a multiplication table for a given number (1 to 10).
*   **Prime Number Check (`P`):** Determine if a number is prime.

### User Experience Enhancements
*   **History (`⟳`):** View a log of past calculations and feature results. You can clear individual items or the entire history.
*   **Theme Toggle (`☀`):** Switch between dark and light themes for personalized aesthetics.
*   **Sound Effects:** Enjoy tactile feedback with customizable click sounds for button presses.
*   **Emoji Indicator:** Visual cues on the display (e.g., 🤔 for active calculation, 😊 for results).
*   **Keyboard Support:** Perform calculations directly using your keyboard for a faster workflow.

## How to Use

1.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  **Basic Calculations:**
    *   Click on number buttons to enter digits.
    *   Click on operator buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) to choose an operation.
    *   Click the `=` button to get the result.
    *   Use `AC` to clear all, and `DEL` to delete the last input.
3.  **Advanced Features:**
    *   Click any button in the feature bar (e.g., `x²`, `√`, `%`).
    *   A popup will appear asking for input. Enter the required number(s) and click "Enter".
    *   For percentage calculations, select the desired mode.
4.  **View History:**
    *   Click the `⟳` (history) button in the header to open the history panel.
    *   Click `Clear All` to erase the history or `×` to delete individual items.
    *   Click `×` in the history header or outside the panel to close it.
5.  **Toggle Theme:** Click the `☀` (theme) button in the header to switch between dark and light modes.
6.  **Customize Sound:** Use the "Sound" toggle to enable/disable button click sounds, and the dropdown to select different click sound types.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

*   **Numbers (0-9) and Decimal (.):** Input corresponding digits.
*   **Operators (+, -, \*, /):** Perform arithmetic operations.
*   **Enter or =:** Calculate the result.
*   **Backspace or Delete:** Delete the last input.
*   **Escape:** Clear all (`AC`).
*   **Inside Feature Popups:**
    *   **Enter:** Execute the feature calculation.
    *   **Escape:** Clear input or close the popup if inputs are empty.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the calculator interface.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, responsive design, and theme switching.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactive functionalities, mathematical logic, DOM manipulation, and advanced feature implementations.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the calculator's structure.
*   `style.css`: Defines the visual styles and themes for the calculator.
*   `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for all calculator operations, history, sound, themes, and feature popups.
